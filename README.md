# Server_Side_Rendering_Demos

This is a demo project that showcases different ways you can achieve server-side rendering without the reliance on frameworks like Next.js. You can also use this repository as a template starter.

## Featured Demos
Currently, there are two demos:
- `Vanilla React`
- `Vite and React`

## Thanks!
I hope this demo serves as a learning resource and a foundation for your own server-side rendering implementations with React. Happy exploring!
